          From Brandcell’s office, Livework’s Beirut partner, we deliver innovative solutions to our clients ever-changing challenges. Our studio Brandcell is located right in the heart of the city, steps away from the Beirut Financial District and the trendy Mar Mikhael area; and right across the street from the best falafel joint in the country. Let’s collaborate!

          It’s better to arrange for a pick up service with your hotel before travelling to Beirut, to avoid being preyed upon by eager taxi drivers at the arrival lounge. We’re a 20 minute car ride away, on the crossroad of “Damascus” and “Bechara Khoury”.
